# Student Daily Usage & Expense Tracker

This tool allows students to track their daily spending and usage habits without ever needing official bank statements. It caters to students who rely on multiple sources of spending—cash, prepaid cards, Venmo transactions, etc.—or even want to monitor time spent on activities like studying or gaming. It emphasizes manual entries or lightweight CSV imports rather than bank-specific data feeds. The idea is to keep things straightforward yet flexible enough for students to get a clear picture of their daily habits.

•  Manual Expense Entry: Each time a student makes a purchase, they open the program and record the date, amount, category, and any additional notes. The app stores these records in a structured format (e.g., a list of dictionaries).

•  Category Summaries: Students can create their own categories such as “Food,” “Entertainment,” “Transport,” or “School Supplies.” The program can then generate a summary—daily, weekly, or monthly—showing how much has been spent in each category.

•  Budget Warnings: Students may wish to set personal budget limits (like $50 a week on snacks). When new expenses are logged, the tool checks the current total for that category and warns the user if they’re nearing or surpassing the limit.

•  Data Visualization: One of the most rewarding aspects is creating charts—for example, a bar chart to compare spending by category or a line chart to see spending trends over time. This helps students instantly identify where their money or time goes.

•  Reporting: Generate neat PDF or HTML summaries of a student’s monthly usage for easy sharing or personal record-keeping.

•  Forecasting: Use linear projections or basic time-series analysis to predict next week’s average spending or usage based on historical patterns, helping students plan ahead.
