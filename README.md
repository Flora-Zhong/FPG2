# Student Weekly Expense Tracker

The Weekly Expense Tracker is a Python-based command-line application designed to help students and individuals monitor their spending habits effectively. By categorizing expenses and comparing them against customizable budgets, the tool provides real-time financial insights through an intuitive interface and visual analytics. Meanwhile, we will also save the historical data of the different usernames. By summarizing the consumption habits of the past few weeks, we can predict the future data and save it to the system background with file I/O. In this way, the program can serve multiple users.

•  Menu: Showing options that users can choose.

•  Add Expense & Set Budget: Users can manually input their expense and budget for a category they set.

•  Category Summaries: Users can create their own categories such as “Food”, “Entertainment”, “Transport”, or “School Supplies.” The program can then generate a weekly summary showing how much has been spent in each category for this week.

•  Budget Warnings: Users may wish to set personal budget limits (like $50 a week on snacks). When new expenses are logged, the tool checks the current total for that category and warns the user if they’re nearing or surpassing the limit.

•  Reset The Week: To show that a week ends, and store the data into history and clear the current week data.

•  Data Visualization: One of the most rewarding aspects is creating charts, a grouped bar chart is shown to compare spending and budget by category.

•  Reporting: Generate the grouped bar chart mentioned above into a PDF summaries of a student’s weekly expense in each category.

•  Forecasting: Showing the mean, median, and standard deviation of history expenses in each category, and make a prediction with mean ± 1 standard deviation.
